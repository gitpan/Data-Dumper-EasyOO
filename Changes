0.04_02

      - wholesale POD redo, with benefit of time and distance, I could
	better appreciate feedback from <mark@summersault.com>
      - speed test now skipped unless passed a true arg
      - code tweaks to improve test coverage
      - better autoprint tests
      - a few additional warnings, useoptions tests

      - yay - I have a user!, with a patch!!
	chocolate.boy@email.com sent a clean fix for the __SA__ hack.
      - various minor test fixes, doc tweaks
	changed diags to pass, to de-clutter test output
      - warning tests are heavily reliant on Test::Warn
      - a couple tests break under 5.00504 - due to modules.
	I just dont have diligence to upgrade my 5.00504 installation
	to correct all these use-time failures. No *real* breakages
      - one particular test annoyance:
	I get: print() on closed filehandle $fh at lib/Data/Dumper/EasyOO.pm
	just b4 test expecting that errmsg passes.  I cant suppress
	it.  That 5.5.4 doesnt have warnings.pm further limits my options.

      - new() is now also a copy constructor, ie: $ez2 = $ez1->new()
      - autoprint.t fixes for WinXP. THANKS! <randy@theoryx5.winnipeg.ca>,
	and for cygwin (somewhat simplistically - \r\n is FS dependent too)

      - import (init => \our $userEzDD) constructs an EzDD object into
	the supplied variable (carps if defined $var)
      - autoprint.t #9 check of $! was linux specific, now handles
	Solaris too, reported by <mthurn@xcgma001.northgrum.com>. Others TBD. 
	Also changed some quoting to qq{} for less platform dependence.

0.02	Mon Dec 22 06:07:45 2003 UTC

      - on 5.6.1, t/chains.t tried to use unsupported DD methods,
	yielding test failures.  Theyre now only called for 5.8
      - fix double plan() in t/speed.t
	this and above reported by Barbie <missbarbell@easynet.co.uk>
      - t/speed.t now uses Test::Benchmark, has old tests as fallback
      - Reworked POD, based on feedback from <mark@summersault.com>
      - added autoprint, which prints when called in void context
      - added use-time print-style control
      - added pp() and dump() methods
