      - new() is now also a copy constructor, ie: $ez2 = $ez1->new()
      - autoprint.t fixes for WinXP. THANKS! <randy@theoryx5.winnipeg.ca>,
	and for cygwin (somewhat simplistically - \r\n is FS dependent too)

      - import (init => \our $userEzDD) constructs an EzDD object into
	the supplied variable (carps if defined $var)
      - autoprint.t #9 check of $! was linux specific, now handles
	Solaris too, reported by <mthurn@xcgma001.northgrum.com>. Others TBD. 
	Also changed some quoting to qq{} for less platform dependence.

      - on 5.6.1, t/chains.t tried to use unsupported DD methods,
	yielding test failures.  Theyre now only called for 5.8
      - fix double plan() in t/speed.t
	this and above reported by Barbie <missbarbell@easynet.co.uk>
      - t/speed.t now uses Test::Benchmark, has old tests as fallback
      - Reworked POD, based on feedback from <mark@summersault.com>
      - added autoprint, which prints when called in void context
      - added use-time print-style control
      - added pp() and dump() methods
